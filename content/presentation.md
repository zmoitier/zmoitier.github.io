## About Me

Since 2022, I am a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of [Maryna Kachanovska](https://sites.google.com/site/mkachanovska/) and [Patrick Joly](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/~pjoly) in the POEMS teams of the UMA at ENSTA Paris (France).

From 2020 to 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of [Rainer Mandel](https://sites.google.com/view/rainermandel) in the Institute for Analysis of the department of mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany).
I was also a member of the Junior Research Group *Nonlinear Helmholtz equations* ([AP2](https://www.waves.kit.edu/AP2.php)) within the [CRC &ndash; 1173 Wave phenomena](https://www.waves.kit.edu/index.php).

From 2019 to 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of [Camille Carvalho](https://camillecarvalho.org/) in the department of applied mathematics at the University of California, Merced (USA).

From 2016 to 2019, I was a PhD student under the supervision of [St&eacute;phane Balac](https://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/stephane.balac/) and [Monique Dauge](https://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/monique.dauge/) in the numerical analysis teams of IRMAR at the University of Rennes 1 (France).
